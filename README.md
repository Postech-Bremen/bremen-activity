## JUNCTIONBREMEN
### Momma
Momma is the Full stacked application which gives Food information and automatically examining nutrient information for pregnant women
The service gives information about nutrients powered by customed AI. Based on eaten foods’ information, user can manage and check their nutrients information in targetting period. Not only providing nutrient from food image, but also analyzing information of delivery food from image, they can easily access to the delivery food with confidence in health information.

Our demo video is analyzing nutrient information from food image, which is work on backend. Also, if you want to evaluate our AI, you can implement jupyter-notebook in our ./Nutrient estimate/Demo/github,

GARi: Shared Mobility Platform with AR and AI

### About
Personal Mobility (PM) refers to individual transportation devices such as electric scooters and bicycles, offering convenience and eco-friendliness. Shared mobility services enable multiple users to access these devices, with examples like GCOO in South Korea. However, safety concerns and parking issues remain significant challenges.

To address these problems, we propose a mobility app incorporating gamified elements inspired by popular games like "Pokémon GO" and "Pikmin Bloom." The app includes an AI-based safety driving score system, rewarding users with discounts for safe driving and proper parking. A ranking system further encourages competition among users. This approach aims to enhance the safety of shared mobility and improve its social perception.
